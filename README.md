# Lesna

Lesna is a plasma chemistry toolbox to make the study of plasma-liquid interactions easier. 

Lesna current primarily serves as a database for:
- Electron cross sections
- Transport coefficients
- Heavy particle reactions
- Interface reactions

Lesna will also provide Python scripts to automate chemistry workflows:
- Cross section estimators
- Input file generators
- Post-processing scripts.

In an effort to encourage use of open-source plasma science, data will be formatted in a manner that requires little-to-no effort
in translate to use in BOLOS, CRANE, ZAPDOS, etc.
