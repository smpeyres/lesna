Welcome to Lesna!

--------------------------------------------------
This toolbox is inspired by Prof. Mark Kushner's 
1999 GEC presentation "Strategies for Rapidly 
Developing Plasma Chemistry Models"

Can find it here (number 29):
https://uigelz.eecs.umich.edu/presentations.html

While this presentation is directed for use in
the microelectronics industry, the strategies 
presented have obvious utility in all areas of 
plasma chemistry! 

Elemenets of the Toolbox 
1. Databases
2. Database Processor
3. Reaction Mechanisms
4. A Basic Global Plasma Model
5. Visualizer and Post-Processor

--------------------------------------------------

What is in the Database?
- Ion and Neutral transport coefficients
- Electron-impact cross sections
- Heavy particle reaction coefficients
- Surface/interface reaction probablities

- Should be as "raw" and unprocessed as possible!

--------------------------------------------------

What is in a Database Processor?
- Primarily, a Boltzmann solver! (BOLSIG+, BOLOS)
- He also mentions a Maxwellian "integrator" of 
    cross sections but I'm not sure what this 
    means!
- This is will not be the focus of Lesna, but 
    Lesna is designed to encourage rapid use of 
    these tools

--------------------------------------------------

What is in the Reaction Mechanisms?
- A collection of previously used (and hopefully 
    validated) reaction mechanisms
- Scaling laws or IYMG (if you must guess) 
    procedures for generating unavailable data

--------------------------------------------------

What is in a Basic Global Plasma Model?
- A rapid and error-less method to convert a 
    reaction mechanism into ODE's and PDE's
- A method to convert "power" into "excitation" 
    (circuit model, EM solver)
- Robust integration technique
- 1D, 2D as required
- This is taken care of with ZAPDOS-CRANE!
- Again, Lesna is designed to encourage rapid use 
    of these tools. 

--------------------------------------------------

What is in a Visualizer and Post-Processor?
- A standardized, rapid way to display and 
    manipulate the results.
- Lesna will include python scripts to process
    csv files from CRANE to visualize results

--------------------------------------------------

In constructing a database, follow said rules:
1. Take FULL advantage of all external resources 
    in building your database.
2. Devise a standard method of formatting, 
    reference, tracking, revisions, and updates 
    which best suit YOUR needs.
3. You will need to make value judgments on 
    goodness, appropriateness, and validity of 
    primary data sources or other databases.
4. Make these decisions with some delibrate 
    forethought as to what the database (or 
    subsets) of the database will be used for.

Remember, data requirements are very different
based on the desired outcome! Incomplete data is
not a bad thing if it is not needed...

--------------------------------------------------

For ease of use in BOLOS/BOLSIG+, all cross 
sections will be eV / m^2.
For ease of use in CRANE-ZAPDOS, all mass, 
transport, and reaction data will be in SI units 
(m, kg, s, V, etc).

Reaction data will focus primarily on, in the 
following order of importance:
    "Air" plasmas 
        (N2/O2)
    Humid "air" plasmas 
        (N2/O2/H2O)
    "Air" plasma - liquid water 
        (N2/O2/H2O + Aqueous)
    True air plasmas
        (N2/O2/H2O/CO2/Ar)
    True air plasma - liquid water
        (N2/O2/H2O/CO2/Ar + Aqueous)

--------------------------------------------------

Sources of Data: Electron-Impact
- Phelps Database
- Morgan Database
- All of LXCat!

--------------------------------------------------

Sources of Data: Neutral Chemistry

Rate Coefficients 
- NIST Chemical Kinetics Database (I personally
     don't like)
- International Journal of Chemical Kinetics
- Journal of Physical Chemistry A
- Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry
- Journal of Physical and Chemical Ref. Data (Love!)

Reaction Mechanisms (Combustion lit)
- Combustion and Flame
- International Journal of Chemical Kinetics
- AIAA Journal
- Models outside your application are with the 
    same species
- Collect everything that key individuals have 
    ever published in the field for specific 
    chemistries (he gives example of Jerome Perrin
    for silane plasma chemistry)
    - Who would my area be?

--------------------------------------------------

Sources of Data: Ion Transport and Ion-Molecule

Mobilities and diffusivities vs E/N (or T(eff))
- In ZAPDOS, ions only have isotropic 
    transport coefficients. I think T(eff) 
    would work best, but I don't know how 
    T(eff) works! 
    - This might help:

Rate Coefficients for Ion:
- J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data

--------------------------------------------------

Generic Plasma Chemistry Model 

Your tool box should include a generic plsama
chemistry model in which all parameters, 
chemistries, and operating conditions are defined
"from the outside" to facilitate rapid turnaround
of reaction mechanisms!

These might be good reads:
    https://doi.org/10.1116/1.579494
    https://doi.org/10.1149/1.2054960
    https://doi.org/10.1109/27.467973

--------------------------------------------------

Demonstration Reactor 

Kushner suggests the use of a small ICP reactor
for demonstration and illustration purposes. In 
my case, I think a simple 1D or 2D model of a DC 
plasma would work great!

--------------------------------------------------

Develop a Reaction Mechanism which Aligns with
What You Need to Know

- Time required scales with size and complexity
- Completeness of reaction mechanism (I think a 
    better word would be network) should correlate
    with the end product of modeling
- What do you really need to know and to what
    accuracy? What data is required to meet goal?

--------------------------------------------------

Make Back of the Envelope Estimates to Refine
(Limit) Your Reaction Network 

You always know upper and lower bounds of reaction
rate coeffs:
    - Ionizate rate coeffs are never much bigger
        than 1e-10 cm3/s (1e-16 m3/s)
    - Momentum transfer rate coeffs never much
        smaller than 1e-10 cm^3/s (1e-16 m3/s)
        - Of electrons? or Heavy species?

Given these bounds, can you make back-of-envelope 
estimates to determine how much detail is required 
in your reaction network?

He gives example of N in N2 with basic rate equations
to get N/N2, but I'm not sure what to do with 
residence time...

--------------------------------------------------

How do you deal with mixtures?

- In large part, if molecules are large enough, 
    momentum transfer and power deposied into given
    component of molecular gas mixture scales with
    mole fraction
- But adding mixtures generates species which would
    not have otherwise been there! These species
    can be very reactive!

--------------------------------------------------

General Scaling Laws: Ion-Ion Neutralization

- All negative ions neutralize with positive ions
    provided that E_IP > E_EA (ionization and 
    electron affinity, I think)
    - GET IONIZATION ENERGY AND ELECTRON AFFINITY
        INFO!
- At thermal energies (and low pressures), 
    neutralization is non-associative 
    - Why? What about high pressure?
- IYMG: k = 1e-7 cm3/s = 1e-13 m3/s

--------------------------------------------------

General Scaling Laws: Electron-Ion Recombination

- All molecular ions dissociatively recombine. If
    Te is not too low (< 300 K) or too high, 
    sigma(mean_en) = sigma_o/mean_en
    https://doi.org/10.1016/0370-1573(90)90159-Y
- IYMG: k = 1e-13*Te^-0.5 m3/s

In low pressure, recombination of atomic ions can
be generally ignored unless plasma densities 
are > 10^12 cm-3
- IYMG (Rad Recomb): k = 5e-19*Te^-0.7 m^3/s
- IYMG (ColRad Recomb): k = 7e-39*Te^-4.5 m^3/s

--------------------------------------------------

General Scaling Laws: Ion Mobilities 

- Use Lennard Jones parameters to calculate 
    mobility.
- IYMG: Choose a LJ radius of similar structured 
    and sized molecule.
- Use mixture rules from a transport theory text
    for additional accuracy.
- All ions undergo symmetric charge exchange with
    their neutral. Assume momentum transfer is 
    dominated by this. If you have chrg-exc cross
    section, use it for momentum transfe. 
    Otherwise, assume gas kinetic rates. 
- If NO additional info, consult 
    https://doi.org/10.1006/adnd.1995.1004
- With rare exceptions, at zero-field momentum 
    transfer cross section is is 5e-20 - 35e-20 m^2

Side note: It seems obvious that a DC global model
would need a bulk-sheath split, but maybe the ion
effective temperature can be adjusted for each 
domain?

--------------------------------------------------

General Scaling Laws: Ion Molecule, Penning, and 
Excitation Transfer

- If energetically allowed, charge transfer by 
    positive ions to polyatomic molecules proceeds
    at the gas kinetic rate (What does this mean? 
    - Collision frequency? ) 
    and is dissociative
    - Branchings are the same as electron impact at
        the IP of ion (if available) or estimated 
        from appearance potentials of fragement ions
    
- If energetically allowed, Penning processess occur
    about 0.2 gas kinetic

- Quenching of excited states by polyatomic ions is
    equivalent to electronic excitation at same
    energy and is dissociative

--------------------------------------------------

General Scaling Laws: Electron Impact Ionization
and Excitation

- Electron impact excitation and ionization cross
    cross sections are the most "species specific"

IYMG:
- Use the same cross sections for fragments (CF3 vs
    CF4) until you REALLY feel really uncomfortable,
    and then deny you did it.
    - Could this be applied to NO, NO2, NO3?
- Reduce threshold energies of excited species by
    the energy.
    - Use same cross section data, but lower the 
        threshold energy 
- If you have input, use Kim cross sections
- If not, resort to Gryzinski or similar
- Use Born-Bethe formula (Drawin form) for optically
    allowed transition for e impact excitation
    - Does this only apply to electronic states?

--------------------------------------------------

How Do You Link Two Reaction Networks?

1. Examine neutral chemistry for important "cross
    reactions"
2. Obtain reaction networks for major products 
3. If mobilities are not known in the novel mixture, 
    assume!
4. Assume all unknown dissociative recomb.
5. Assume all unknown ion-ion recomb. 
6. Charge exchange cross sections not known. Obtain
    thermochemistry, assume gas kinetic.
